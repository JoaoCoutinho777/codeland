Developed in React JS with Material UI 5 Codeland is a web app where you can watch videos related to programming.

While I was studing React I have the idea to create a place where I could focused only on study subjects related to programming without outside distractions like random videos suggestions that always appear on youtube or other platforms. And I saw this idea as an oportunity to practice and test my skills.
